<h3>3. Return to Me</h3>
<p>Great ensemble cast. Improbable yet plausible plot premise.  Really it's the supporting charaters that make this a great movie. Bonnie Hunt did a great job writing and Directing.</p>
<h3>2. Chocolat√©</h3>
<p>Amazingly beautiful and stunning symbolism. great characters, moving plot</p>

<h3>1. Ever After</h3>
<p>Best Cinderella rendition ever</p>
